This repository contains scripts to perform simulations on Xylella fastidiosa metabolic model (Xfm1158).

The flexflux folder contains the commands and constraints to perform the analysis (FBA, FVA, KO, efficiency) presented
in the associated paper on both Xylella fastidiosa and Ralstonia solanacearum.

The file XF_network.sbml is the metabolic model Xfm1158 in SBML format.

The file XFCFBP8418.fasta contains the sequences used for metabolic network reconstruction.
